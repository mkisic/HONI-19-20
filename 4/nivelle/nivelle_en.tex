\textit{Original task description has been altered due to excessive violence.
The following program is suitable for minors.}

Bojan sees $N$ cute little fluffy edible toys \textit{(yaay!)} on a store shelf,
ordered from $1$ to $N$. Each fluffy toy is colored in one of $26$ different
colors. Each color is denoted by a lowercase letter from the English alphabet.
Bojan wants to eat some of these toys \textit{(drool)}.

For any set of toys, we can define its \textit{colorfulness} as the number of
different colors of toys in a set, divided by the total number of toys in a
set. Bojan hates colorfulness. Bojan is very hungry. Bojan wants to eat a
contiguous subsequence of toys.

Help Bojan find a contiguous subsequence of toys whose colorfulness is as
small as possible.

% Input
\subsection*{Input}
The first line contains an integer $N$ $(1 \le N \le 100\ 000)$, the length
of array of toys from task description.

The second line contains a string $S$ of length $N$. The $i$-th character of
the string represents the color of $i$-th toy from the shelf.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Output
\subsection*{Output}
Output two indices $L$ and $R$ $(1 \le L \le R \le N)$, which denote that the
sought contiguous subsequence of toys is located at positions $L$, $L+1$,
\dots, $R$.

If there exists more than one contiguous subsequence with the same minimal
colorfulness, you can output $L$ and $R$ which define any of them.
