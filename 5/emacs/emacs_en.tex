%\subsection*

While playing in his favourite text editor, Daniel decided to draw a picture
that was $N$ characters high and $M$ characters wide. The picture consists
solely of characters \texttt{'.'} and \texttt{'*'} such that characters
\texttt{'*'} form some non-overlapping rectangles. The rectangles don't even
touch each other on their sides or corners.

Help Daniel count the number of rectangles drawn on the picture.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Input
\subsection*{Input}
The first line contains two integers $N$ and $M$ $(1 \le N, M \le 100)$ from
task description. \\
Each of The next $N$ lines contains $M$ characters \texttt{'.'} or
\texttt{'*'} which represent the picture that Daniel drew.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Output
\subsection*{Output}
In a single line you should output the number of rectangles on the picture.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Scoring
\subsection*{Scoring}
In the test cases worth a total of $10$ points, all rectangles will consist
of a single \texttt{'*'} character.\\
In the test cases worth additional $15$ points, it will hold $N = 1$.
