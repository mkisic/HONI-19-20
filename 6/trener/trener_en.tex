At this point we already know that students love to sleep. Patrik is a record
holder in this category. He wakes up only when he needs to eat or if he
wishes to play \textit{FIFA 20}. Therefore, his dreams usually revolve around
football. In his last dream, he found himself in the role of a football manager
of his favourite team -- GNK Dinamo Zagreb.

His job is to select $N$ players that will defend the blue colors in the next
season, but the board has some peculiar requests. They are:

\begin{itemize}
  \item All players must have surnames of distinct lengths.
  \item Surname of a player must appear as a continuous subsequence of surnames
        of all players whose surnames are longer.
\end{itemize}

To make his job easier, Patrik divided the potential players in $N$ buckets
such that players in $i$-th bucket have exactly $i$ letters in their surname.
In each of these buckets there are exactly $K$ players. Patrik wants to know
in how many distinct ways (modulo $10^9 + 7$) can he choose the players for
his squad while also conforming to the given requests.

% Input
\subsection*{Input}
The first line contains two integers $N$ $(1 \le N \le 50)$ and $K$ $(1 \le K \le 1\
500)$.

Each of the next $N$ lines contains $K$ not necessarily distinct surnames of
players. The surnames of players in $i$-th of those lines consist of exactly
$i$ lowercase letters from the English alphabet.

% Output
\subsection*{Output}
In the only line you should output the answer from the task description.

\textbf{Clarification of the first example:}
Patrik can choose the following teams:
\texttt{(a, ab, abc)}, \texttt{(a, ab, abd)},
\texttt{(b, ab, abc)}, \texttt{(b, ab, abd)} and \texttt{(b, bd, abd)}.
